# 🌍 Climate Change EDA — Understanding Earth's Future with Data

This project explores the rising levels of **CO₂ in the atmosphere** and **global temperature trends** using real-world datasets from:
- 🌋 **Mauna Loa Observatory** (CO₂ levels)
- 🌡️ **Berkeley Earth** (Global land and ocean temperatures)

## 📊 What’s Inside?
- Data cleaning and wrangling
- Visualizing average temperatures across US states
- CO₂ trends from 1958 to present
- Predictive modeling for future CO₂ levels
- Correlation analysis between CO₂ and global temperature rise

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Linear Regression Model

## 📈 Key Insight
> If current trends continue, **CO₂ levels may reach 437.3 ppm by 2030** — a point at which climate damage may become **irreversible**, as per the IPCC.
